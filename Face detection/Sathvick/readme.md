# face_detection
In this we will be detecting faces using the webcam of our laptop and using a face cascade.
Face will be detected from the webcam and we can also know the percentage of time for which face was detected in the entire time the webcam was on.This can be helpful in many ways such as knowing the amount of time a student is present in front of webcam during online classes or amount of time a face was detected in any confidential places.
